NOTE: Since this is a transparent call of docker image from command line, where new files are generated, so it is a good idea to run docker image as a host user, not as a root.


  docker run -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v `pwd`:/work jbake  



== Integrate into shell as function

.shell
[source, bash]

jbake() {
    docker run -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -p 8820:8820 -v `pwd`:/work jbake "$@"
