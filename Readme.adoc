NOTE: Since this is a transparent call of docker image from command line, where new files are generated, it is a good idea to root in docker as a host user, not as a root.


  docker run -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v `pwd`:/work jbake  



== Integrate into shell as function

Add following code into you shel config file (e.g. ~/.zhsrc, etc.) 

.shell
[source, bash]
----
jbake() {
    docker run -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -p 8820:8820 -v `pwd`:/work mh/jbake "$@"

}
----

or execute following code to export jbake as shell function:

    source jbake.env


NOTE: Integrated server is functional yet
